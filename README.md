# Jubilee Austen Website

### Overview
This one-page website showcases a minimalist design (provided to me as part of a Skillcrush project) and uses IDs to link the navigation to specific sections of the website.  After continuing to learn more coding skills, I returned to this project to make it a bit more responsive.

### Features
This site was coded using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
